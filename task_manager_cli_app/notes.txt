Core Features

User Management 
    - Create users with roles (use Enums for roles: Admin, Developer, Manager).
    - Store users in memory (array) or JSON file.

Task System
    - Create tasks with status (Pending, In Progress, Done).
    - Assign tasks to users.
    - Use Interfaces, Generics for task storage.

Project & Team Handling
    - Group tasks under projects.
    - Assign teams.
    - Use Nested Types, Intersection Types for complex data models.

CLI Interaction
    - Use readline for user input.
    - Commands like:
        - add user
        - create task
        - list tasks
        - update status
        - show dashboard (role-based views!)

Status & Role Dashboards
    - Conditionally render outputs based on user role using Enums.

Utility Functions
    - Use Generics for reusable storage logic (e.g., TaskContainer<T>).
    - Apply Partial, Omit, Exclude for flexible updates.

Type Utilities
    - Extract types from functions or constants.
    - Use keyof, ReturnType, Awaited for handling dynamic operations (e.g., simulate async DB fetch).

Concept	Application in Project
Interfaces	        Define User, Task, Project structures
Enums	            User roles, task statuses
Union Types     	Handle flexible inputs (`string
Generics	        Create reusable storage or service classes
Partial/Required	Update tasks with flexible or strict requirements
Omit/Exclude	    Customize views or data responses
Intersection	    Combine User & Task for assigned tasks
Typeof / keyof	    Work dynamically with object keys
Async/Awaited	    Simulate async data fetching

Bonus Features (For Scaling Later)
Data Persistence: Save/load data from a JSON file.
Authentication Simulation: Login/logout flow.
Filters & Search: List tasks by status or assignee.
Notifications: Console logs when deadlines are near (simulate).
Export Reports: Generate a .txt summary of tasks/projects.
Role-Based Restrictions: Only Admin can delete tasks.

Sample User Flow:
Welcome to TaskManager CLI!
Type a command: 

> add user
Enter name: Kirk
Select role: (admin/user/manager): admin
User created!

> create task
Task title: Fix Login Bug
Assign to user ID: 1
Set status: pending
Task created!

> list tasks
[1] Fix Login Bug - Assigned to: Kirk - Status: Pending

> update status
Enter Task ID: 1
New Status: in_progress
Task updated!

> show dashboard
[Admin Dashboard]
- Total Users: 5
- Tasks Pending: 3
- Tasks In Progress: 2
